# Introduction #

PhotoShare is an example Haggle application we have created to illustrate how easy it is to write Haggle applications using our APIs. PhotoShare exists in two versions: one for Windows mobile and one for Android.

PhotoShare allows a user with a mobile phone to easily share pictures taken with the phone's camera. When taking a picture, the user can annotate it with any number of keywords that will be added to the picture's metadata. The picture is then published in the Haggle network and users that have interests matching the metadata will receive it. The more interests that match a picture's metadata, the higher the likelihood is that the user will receive the picture.

# Screenshots #

Below are some screenshots of the Android version of PhotoShare.
