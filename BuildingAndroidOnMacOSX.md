This page is an addition to QuickStartAndroid that describes requirements when building Android on a Mac OS X 10.6 host system (64-bit).

Android compiles cleanly on Mac OS X 10.6 using the 'master' branch as of August 5, 2010. This might very well change in the future, as the 'master' branch is updated. You need to follow the instructions for [building on Mac OS X](http://source.android.com/source/download.html) on the Android developer web site.
